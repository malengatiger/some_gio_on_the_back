/// Competition
Some potential competitors for Geo when it comes to near real-time services, push notifications, and dynamic timelines could be other location-based services such as Foursquare, Swarm,
 or Yelp. These services provide users with real-time information about places and events in their area, and offer the ability to receive push notifications
  for updates or promotions.

Another potential competitor could be social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, which offer location-based features and real-time updates
through their newsfeeds and alerts.

However, it's important to note that while these services may have some overlapping features with Geo, they may not provide the same level of
organization and project management tools that Geo offers. Geo's focus on organizing multimedia timelines and geographic data into organizations,
projects, and users sets it apart from other location-based services and social media platforms.
